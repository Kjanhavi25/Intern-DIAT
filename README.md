**Super Resolution using GANs**

**Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of an Image Super Resolution model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
The primary goal is to enhance the resolution and quality of low-resolution images without relying on pre-trained models. The approach leverages a custom-designed GAN architecture tailored for high-quality image upscaling.
